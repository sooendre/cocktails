static/cocktails.json is a file containing cocktail names and ingredients required to make cocktails.
Using the file I want to create an app that has a tag style autocomplete text field, which can take names of cocktail ingredients.
Then based on the given ingredients lists the full cocktail recipes that can be made from those ingredients.
Add some basic styling using next modules.
Use typescript

at this point if I select more ingredients the app queries the cocktails that contain both, but I want it to query either
what changes do I have to make
